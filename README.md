jnetwork-monitor
================

monitor monitor to detect specific network and do task.( for "tsinghua" wifi.)

================
I give up this project .because if I want to get the SSID or change network config, I have to use JNI. It's toooooooooooo complex.

If so, why not write a shell and use iwlist iwscan and so on?
